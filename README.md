# graphql-server-with-typescript

A simple [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) server using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## About

Currently, in 2019, to create a GraphQL API it's necessary to write a [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) with the types of inputs and outputs of server, which is usually defined in a text file called `schema.graphql`. That is not a problem for applications that use pure JavaScript, but it can create a headache if you want to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to ensure code type-safety, because TS-compiler can't infer typings inside text file and the developer need to manually sync the GraphQL schema with TypeScript types and **this is NOT productive**.

## Solutions

Some time ago, I [tried to create a server](https://github.com/httpiago/graphql-and-typescript-legacy) using a package called "[type-graphql](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql)" which aims to automate the creation of the schema based on code writed using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html). I reached my goal and I was pleased with the result, but now I found some problems looking at the code: decorators are not a standard yet, the code gets more verbose and difficult for other developers to maintain and the package in question still needs to be improved.

Anyway, with this project I want to try the reverse approach: automate the creation of code typings based on GraphQL schema and this time I will use another package called "[graphql-codegen](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator)".

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/httpiago/graphql-server-with-typescript.git
cd graphql-server-with-typescript
yarn install
```

and start the server:

```bash
yarn run start
```

## To do

- [x] Install [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server).
- [x] Install [graphql-codegen](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator).
- [x] Create revolvers for users.
- [x] Create resolvers for tweets.
- [x] Create subscription to listen new tweets.
- Security:
  - [x] Create an authentication system.
  - [ ] Limit query complexity.
  - [ ] Limit query depth.
- [ ] Make server publicly available with [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
- [ ] Improve documentation here in README.
  - List used packages.
  - List the cli commands.
  - Show with a flowchart how is the workflow using the command `yarn run dev`.
  - Explain the security mechanisms.
  - Show some sample queries.
  - Warn that all codes are well documented and is a realistic example.
- [ ] Try to separate resolvers and schema into modules (in different folders and files).
- [ ] Write some tests just to see.
  - Use [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) ðŸ¤©.
